When you open VS Code, the TypeScript server starts in the background. It will
be active as long as you have a TypeScript file open.

## Autocomplete

You'll often want to manually trigger autocomplete. In VS Code, the Ctrl + Space
keyboard shortcut will show you a list of suggestions for what you're typing.

## TypeScript Error Checking

Sometimes TypeScript will warn you about things that will definitely fail at
runtime. Not everything TypeScript warns us about will actually fail at runtime.
It may seem strange that TypeScript would warn us about something that won't
cause an error, but it's actually a good thing.
